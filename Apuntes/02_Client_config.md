Chef Client Configuration
=========================
Client configuration is stored on the client's computer `/etc/chef` directory. Inside that directory, in the _client.rb_ file we have some settings that can be configured, such as:
+ The log location
+ The chef server url
+ The node name
+ The location of the trusted certificates from the chef servers.
